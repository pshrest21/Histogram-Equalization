# Histogram Equalization

In this project, we will equalize the histogram of two images : 'fish.pgm', and 'jet.pgm'

We use openCV to read these files

Along with histogram equalization, we also perform other image processings such as:
- image slicing
- contrast stretching

The histograms of the resulting images are saved as .png files.
